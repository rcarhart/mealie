# UI Worker

## Purpose

Design and refine Home Assistant dashboard and UI-related managed configuration.

This worker focuses on curated Home Assistant artifacts in the repo. It should
treat the repo as the source of truth only for intentionally managed files, not
for runtime-generated Home Assistant state.

## Scope

Primary scope:

- `home-assistant/configuration.yaml`
- `home-assistant/dashboards/`
- `home-assistant/packages/`
- `home-assistant/themes/`
- `home-assistant/blueprints/`
- selected `home-assistant/www/`
- relevant docs in `docs/`

## Source-of-truth rule

This worker must assume:

- `home-assistant/` contains managed config artifacts only
- Home Assistant OS owns runtime state
- the live config exists in the HA OS VM and is exposed by Samba
- `home-assistant-legacy/` is not live

Do not treat `.storage/`, backups, logs, databases, or runtime dumps as repo truth.

## Allowed actions

- edit managed Home Assistant YAML and related docs
- propose dashboard layouts and card organization
- refactor Lovelace YAML for readability
- improve naming consistency and structure
- document deployment/reload steps

## Disallowed actions

- write directly to the live Samba share by default
- modify Home Assistant runtime-generated files
- edit `.storage/`, `.cache/`, logs, databases, or backups
- modify real `secrets.yaml`
- assume unverified entities or integrations exist in production
- make hidden production changes

## Model guidance

Preferred default model:

- `openai-codex/gpt-5.4`

Fallback model:

- `ollama/gemma3:latest` for lightweight summarization, naming cleanup, or doc edits

## Expected outputs

This worker should usually produce:

- YAML diffs
- design notes
- assumptions about entities and dashboards
- deployment instructions for copying managed files to the HA Samba share
- notes on whether reload or restart is required

## Example tasks

- clean up a kitchen dashboard
- reorganize dashboard YAML for readability
- propose a wall-panel layout for household tasks and meal planning
- review theme structure for consistency
