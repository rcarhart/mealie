# Honey Do Dashboard

This repo now contains separate Home Assistant dashboard paths for household chores and projects:

- `dashboards/honey-do.yaml`
- `dashboards/honey-do-grocy.yaml`
- `dashboards/honey-do-projects.yaml`

## Native Home Assistant Version

The native version uses YAML helpers and automations from:

- `packages/honey_do.yaml`

Features:

- fixed-owner project list with due dates
- recurring chores that start unclaimed
- weekly reset every Monday at 5:00 AM
- completion tracking directly from the dashboard

## Grocy Version

The Grocy chores version is wired for the expected Grocy entities and the custom integration has been copied into:

- `home-assistant/custom_components/grocy`

Recommended Grocy modeling:

- recurring chores as Grocy chores
- one-off honey-do items as Grocy tasks on the separate projects dashboard
- Ross and Kelly as task categories
- owner also included in task names for clarity
- chore claiming handled in Home Assistant helpers for a better wall-dashboard UX

Home Assistant setup:

1. Add the `Grocy` integration in Settings > Devices & Services
2. Use URL `http://192.168.86.47`
3. Use port `9192`
4. Paste the Grocy API key in the config flow
5. Enable:
   - `sensor.grocy_tasks`
   - `sensor.grocy_chores`
   - `binary_sensor.grocy_overdue_tasks`
   - `binary_sensor.grocy_overdue_chores`

The Grocy chores and projects dashboards use shared summary/helpers from:

- `packages/grocy_honey_do.yaml`

Canonical Grocy URL for this homelab:

- `http://192.168.86.47:9192`

This is also documented in:

- `app/grocy/README.md`
- `home-assistant/dashboards/honey-do-grocy.yaml`
